# Deep learning-based evaluation of ultrasound images for benign skin tumors
- A new architecture was trained for classify 3 different benign skin tumors from ultrasound images
- The classification performance was evaluated with various evaluation metrices after 5-fold cross validation
- For visual reliability, grad-CAM method was conducted to trained model
